# openapi4s-demo

Petstore [spec](api/resources/openapi.json) is downloaded on 26.12.2024 from https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json

Here is a video demo: https://youtu.be/kf0vGrlKNb8

## Usage
```shell
# 1. update the openapi.json

# 2. (re)generate
./mill api.compile

# 3. see what changed
git diff

# 4. fill in the details
./mill api.compile

# 5. git commit
```

By default, all endpoints will return 501 NotImplemented status.  
You just need to fill in the details. :) 

OpenApi4s will only overwrite definitions that it wrote originally (not the expressions though!).  
Any class/method/val generated by OpenApi4s can be overwritten if you change it manually!  
Other code (e.g. business logic in controller), *that you wrote* will not be touched. :)
